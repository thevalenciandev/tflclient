# tflclient
A python lightweight client allowing to query data from the TFL Line API 
(https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/api-details#api=Line)

# How to install
This library is still under development. For now you can check this repo out 
and run the following command to make tflclient available to your projects via
a python import:
`python -m pip install -e .`

# Run
See the `examples` folder for example scripts using tflclient.

# Notes
Only a very small subset of API endpoints are implemented. More will be
added in future.
